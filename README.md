# drv_package_v2.0

![overview](https://github.com/DrawZeroPoint/drv_package_v2/blob/master/supplements/figures/1.png )

Deep Robot Vision (DRV) 2.0 system for NEU Vision Gear, a functional robot head with 1 RGB-D sensor, 2 DOF and 3D printed shell. 
Have a glance over the [wiki](https://github.com/DrawZeroPoint/drv_package_v2/wiki) for details.

For the 1.0 version of DRV, refer https://github.com/NEU-TEAM/drv_package.

*We refer this package, aka drv_package_v2 as DRV in the following instructions.*

## 1. Software prerequisites
### 1.1 ROS
We run this package in **indigo**, other versions of ROS *may not* be supported.

### 1.2 py-faster-rcnn
This package is not included in the `drv_package_v2`, you need to get it from <https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn>, 
and install it following the official guide (the customized Caffe installation part is basically the same with installing 
ordinary Caffe when using cmake). Notice that if you use cuDNN 5.0 or above, `git clone https://github.com/donghongwen/py-faster-rcnn_cudnnv5.git` instead. 
After that, you need download the *VGG16_faster_rcnn_final.caffemodel* by executing `./data/scripts/fetch_faster_rcnn_models.sh` in `$PY_FASTER_RCNN` and put it into `DRV/supplements/object_recognize`. Notice that the download address of the model has been changed to https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/6joa55k64xo2h68/Makefile.config?dl=0

### 1.3 rosserial
Please refer [Arduino IDE Setup](http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup) for using rosserial. 
To use it with NVG, we basically need to 1) `sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-rosserial-arduino` and `sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-rosserial`. 
2) Install the library ros_lib. 3) Install the libraries you might not have: FastLed, VerSpeedServo and JY901. 
The first two libraries can be found in Arduino official repository, the last is provided in DRV/supplements/arduino_control.
We use **rosserial_arduino** to communicate between one Arduino Mega 2560 board and an JY61 6-axis accelerator. 
The Arduino controls 2 servos, one for pitching the RGBD-camera (Orbbec ASTRA S) and the other for rotating it. 
The accelerator measures the pitch and yaw angles of the camera. 
The .ino file loaded on the Arduino board is provided in folder `$DRV/supplements/arduino_control`, 
you can load it to your board with Arduino IDE <http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software>.

### 1.4 Orbbec Astra
First clone the repo https://github.com/orbbec/ros_astra_camera.git and https://github.com/orbbec/ros_astra_launch.git 
into your catkin_ws, then do `catkin_make --pkg astra_camera -DFILTER=ON` in /catkin_ws.
If you get error: `Getting "fatal error: libudev.h: No such file or directory #include <libudev.h>"` 
when compiling the package, do `sudo apt-get install libudev-dev`. `sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-rgbd-launch` if necessary.
After that, `roscd astra_camera && ./scripts/create_udev_rules` to make astra udev rules. Run it by `roslaunch astra_launch astra.launch`
You can find the calibration files for our devices (Astra S) in folder *DRV/supplements/camera_info* for reference purpose. 
When running in ROS, this folder should be put into `/home/YOUR_USERNAME/.ros`.

### 1.5 GOTURN (Deprecated)
We used to using GOTURN as our object tracking backbone, however, it performs slow in CPU-only computer such that 
we turn to Correlation Filter method (KCF). The algorithm using GOTURN is still provided for reference purpose. 
GOTURN itself is not necessarily needed to run tracking, we only need the trained model *tracker.caffemodel* and prototext *tracker.prototxt* in 
`DRV/supplements/object_track/`. You can get the model from <https://github.com/davheld/GOTURN>.

### 1.6 NEU_FACE
We provide the face recognition function based on [VGG_Face](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/vgg_face/). 
To perform face recognition, the caffe model (i.e. *finetune_neu_face.caffemodel*) and prototext (*neu_face_deploy.prototxt*) 
should in `DRV/supplements/face_recognize/`. We also provide the online training method of the face recognition model. 
To use it, you may need install rosauth from https://github.com/DrawZeroPoint/rosauth first to use the authentication function. 
For the usage detail, refer Part.4.8

### 1.7 gpd
We optionally use [gpd](https://github.com/atenpas/gpd) to generate grasp pose. You may need to install it first to compile DRV. 
We provide the launch file `drv_gpd_port.launch` to run gpd in `DRV/drv_brain/launch`

### 1.8 image_view2
We optionally use [image_view2](https://github.com/NEU-TEAM/image_view2) which developed by [jsk](https://github.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_common.git) 
to select the target. We modified the code add removed some OpenCV 3 features to be compatible with ROS Indigo.

## 2 Hardware
To run searching and tracking modules smoothly, a workstation with NVIDIA GPU which has at least 4GB of GRAM is necessary. 
If the machine has no GPU, it can only run in **simple** mode which means no searching or face recognition can be performed.
The host computer's CPUs run at frequencies exceeding 2.4 GHz. Low frequencies will lead to a delay in point cloud 
capturing and communication between the workstation and the host PC.
This program has also been tested on multi-machine configurations.

## 3. Installation
1. Clone this repository into catkin_ws/src (we assume your ROS work space has the name *catkin_ws*):
`git clone https://github.com/DrawZeroPoint/drv_package_v2.git`
2. Add the line `source /home/USER/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash` to your ~/.bashrc.
2. Run `catkin_make --pkg drv_msgs` in ~/catkin_ws to generate header file used by other nodes in DRV.
3. Run `catkin_make` in ~/catkin_ws to make all packages and nodes.
4. Add these two lines into your ~/.bashrc:
 ```
export PYTHONPATH="/home/USER/py-faster-rcnn/lib:/home/USER/py-faster-rcnn/caffe-fast-rcnn/python:${PYTHONPATH}"
export DRV=/home/USER/catkin_ws/src/drv_package_v2
 ```
 **Replace 'USER' with your actual username**

## 4. Usage
1. Run `roscore` first. Plug in the power supply and cables of NVG.
2. There are multiple ways you can run drv_package by launch file. First, if you are on a single machine with GPU, you can run `roslaunch drv_brain drv_v2_single_gpu.launch` which will start all nodes in drv_package. Second, if you are on a single machine with only CPU, you can run `roslaunch drv_brain drv_v2_single_cpu.launch` to launch the GPU-free nodes, which means the recognition functions will not work. 
If you are in 2 machines configuration, which means you have 2 PCs and one of them is the host on the robot with only CPU and the another is your workstation having GPU, you can SSH to your host from the workstation and run `roslaunch drv_brain drv_v2_host.launch`, and run `roslaunch drv_brain drv_v2_workstation.launch` so that the GPU computation will be performed remotely. 
3. If you let arg "pub_pose_once_id" in drv_v2_workstation_simple.launch.xml to be true, it will publish object pose for only once for one detection. 
4. The whole vision system runs in namespace /vision, and you can change it by modifying the arg "ns". Meanwhile, you need to pay attention to the launch file drv_v2_host.launch.xml, in which we assume your Arduino board link to USB port "/dev/Arduino_vision", you can make this symlink by following [this instruction](http://www.joakimlinde.se/microcontrollers/arduino/avr/udev.php). Briefly, you need create a udev rule file (a example can be found in folder `DRV/supplements/arduino_control`, notice that your serial is different form ours) for Arduino and put it into the folder `/etc/udev/rules.d`. To make the rules work, you may re-plugin the Arduino or reboot your computer. 
5. Target can be assigned by setting the rosparam: `rosparam set /comm/control/target/label bottle`, `rosparam set /comm/control/target/is_set true`, the order of these settings should not be changed. Here the 'bottle' refers to the target label and can be changed to 'chair', 'person', etc. as long as it belongs to Pascal_VOC categories. FYI, the target setting function as well as more useful functions can be easily realized with [JARVIS](https://github.com/NEU-TEAM/JARVIS), which is an Android app for controlling the NEU household robot. Till now it only supports Android 6.0+.
6. With the target set, the system will automatically run in *search mode* and find the target in the scene. When some objects which likely to be the target were found, the system will request user select to judge the candidates and decide whether continuing searching the target or tracking the selected target. If the target is confirmed, the system will run in *tracking mode* in which the location of the target in 3D space will be generated for manipulating the target.
7. By setting the target *is_set* param to be *false*, the system will run in *wander mode* and do nothing.
8. You can recognize face in the scene by setting the params: 
`rosparam set /comm/control/target/label face`, `rosparam set /comm/control/target/is_set true`. 
Notice that this only happens in *wander mode*. With these params set, the system will use model described in 1.6 to detect faces. 
9. You can also train on your own data set by capturing face image online. To do that, First you need set param to capture images: 
`rosparam set /vision/face/train/name NAME`. 
Replace NAME with the actual name of that person. 
After that, the person shall stand in front of the camera and 100 face images will be captured by default. 
Then you can perform training by set param: `rosparam set /vision/face/need_train true` and the training will then be performed. Notice that this will run in GPU workstation. If you use password, you may set it by `rosparam set /password PASSWORD`, the default password is 'admin' which stored in 'DRV/supplements/password'

## 5. Trouble Shooting
1. If custom message issue occurred when running catkin_make, run `catkin_make --pkg drv_msgs --force-cmake` 
first to make the msg header files needed, and then run `catkin_make`.

2. If you can't run the python nodes, make sure they have authority to be executed.
 
## 6. Development details
1. To demonstrate the status of the robot, we use full-color LEDs to show the status with these light code (std_msgs::UInt16) definition.
The message should be published to '/vision/error'.
> 0: normal (green)

> 1: warning (yellow) 2: error (red) 3: fatal error (red flash)

> 10: fully bright (white) 11: extinguished (black) 12: breathing light (flashing purple) 


2. The servo angles are published to /vision/servo, and transferred to /vision/motor which directly received by servos. 
These messages are in `std_msgs::UInt16MultiArray` format and the vector can contain 2, 3 or 4 parameters, 
including [pitch_angle, yaw_angle], [pitch_angle, yaw_angle, speed_for_both] or [pitch_angle, yaw_angle, pitch_speed, yaw_speed]. 
The pitch angle is in range [60, 140], and yaw angle is in range [0, 180]. You can publish the message like this: 
`rostopic pub /vision/servo std_msgs/UInt16MultiArray '{data: [90, 90]}' --once`, you should not directly publish to `/vision/motor`.

3. To speed up the system, we let the image being published in 15Hz by setting data_skip as 1. Besides, 
we let the most used image topic to have jpeg_quality equal to 40, and search result image quality to be 20. See the launch files for detail.
